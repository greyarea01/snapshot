Things to consider doing next:

1. Remove $http from the controller and add a service to provide the data
     - will remove dependency of the crate controller on $http
2. Increase complexity of getting data so we can grab multiple tables
3. Improve routing so we can use full URLs crates/iov/crate/rod/mur/mod/... etc
4. Add persistency for dataStore - localStorage? IndexedDB?
5. Improve diff functionality
6. Additional navigation tools:
     - some kind of crate/slot/mur/mod/chip selector in the page

7. IOV navigate?
8. Run navigation
   last two need additional work adding new APIs to the server end.
   IOV - grabbing extra IOV info from the COOL DB
   Run - also stored in the COOL DB somewhere.
