Things to consider doing next:

1. Remove $http from the controller and add a service to provide the data
     - will remove dependency of the crate controller on $http DONE
2. Increase complexity of getting data so we can grab multiple tables.... TO DO
3. Improve routing so we can use full URLs crates/iov/crate/rod/mur/mod/... etc IN PROGRESS
   3a. set up routes DONE
   3b. translate routeParams into an index object
   3c. modify dataStore to get a model based on the index object
   3d. modify dataStore to do http requests to fill model if a new index is requested
   3e. ...


4. Add persistency for dataStore - localStorage? IndexedDB?
5. Improve diff functionality
6. Additional navigation tools:
     - some kind of crate/slot/mur/mod/chip selector in the page

7. IOV navigate?
8. Run navigation
   last two need additional work adding new APIs to the server end.
   IOV - grabbing extra IOV info from the COOL DB
   Run - also stored in the COOL DB somewhere.
